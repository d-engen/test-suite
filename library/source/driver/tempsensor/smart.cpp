//! @todo Add smart temperature sensor implementation details here!

/**
 * @note Requirements:
 * 
 *       1. Prediction: The sensor shall predict temperature based on the input voltage from the 
 *                      associated pin.
 *       2. Voltage Measurement: The input voltage shall be measured using an A/D converter.
 *       3. Model Usage: The sensor shall use a pre-trained linear regression model for temperature 
 *                       prediction.
 *       4. Initialization Prerequisites:
 *           - The associated pin must be a valid ADC channel.
 *           - The ADC must be initialized.
 *           - The linear regression model must be pre-trained.
